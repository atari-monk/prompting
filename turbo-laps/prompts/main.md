## Scene Mode Setup [x]

- We have Scene Mode "all" and "current"
- In "all" mode we want to register scenes selected for game
- In "current" mode we want to register all scenes and select one for testing by providing its index in array
- Refactor main to reflect these requirerments
- If its already implemented just check it
