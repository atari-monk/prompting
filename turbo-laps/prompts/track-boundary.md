# track-boundary.ts

## Convert form js to ts [x]

- Use latest typescript
- Convert from js to ts class
- Clsss must implement Scene interface
- Use rectangle-track.ts as a dependency instead of js track
- Use arrow-player.ts as dependency instead of js car

## Extract logic [x]

- turbo-laps.js has logic that should be in track_boundary.ts
- convert it to ts and move it to track_boundary.ts

## Integrate scenes [x]

- Given the code base i would like u to integrate track_boundary.ts
- I mean by that, after generating insctance and regeistering it
- It should just work like any scene
- If this is implemented already, just check it
