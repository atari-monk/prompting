# main.ts (turbo-laps-scenelet)

## Scene Mode Setup [x]

- We have Scene Mode "all" and "current"
- In "all" mode we want to register scenes selected for game
- In "current" mode we want to register all scenes and select one for testing by providing its index in array
- Refactor main to reflect these requirerments
- If its already implemented just check it

## Finish single scene main []

- Add register functions for remainding scenes
- Use them in main register function
