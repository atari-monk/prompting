    "Requirements": [
        "Provide a high-level summary of the code's purpose and initial quality impression.",
        "Analyze Performance & Scalability: time/space complexity, bottlenecks, memory usage.",
        "Analyze Readability & Style: naming, structure, comments, language idioms.",
        "Analyze Maintainability & Robustness: error handling, testability, coupling, edge cases.",
        "Analyze Security: vulnerabilities if applicable (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).",
        "For each suggested change, provide: the suggestion, argument for, argument against (trade-offs).",
        "Categorize suggestions by priority: P0 (Critical), P1 (High), P2 (Medium), P3 (Low).",
        "Discuss alternative paradigms or algorithms for non-trivial problems with trade-offs.",
        "Ground reasoning in principles like DRY, KISS, Single Responsibility Principle."
