## Daily Stats File [x]

- I need to add a format for daily stats file
- It is a one special file that handles daily stats for project log files
- This should only handle file "C:\Atari-Monk-Art\productivity\content\daily-projects.yaml"
- Format was evolving so handle added fileds as optional
- Script is similar in some ways to productivity_logs but separate in productivity_daily
